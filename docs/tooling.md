Wagtail Wordpress Import makes it easy to work with the raw data by providing a set of command line tools.

## Reduce XML command

This is a command to help you reduce the amount of data that needs to be parsed and imported.

```bash
python manage.py reduce_xml path/to/your/xmlfile.xml
```

It will remove all items of `<wp:comment>`. These xml tags represent comments.

The original file is preserved and a new file is created with `-reduced` appended to the file name.

## Analyse XML commands

These commands help you analyse the XML data source.

### analyze_html_content

Will generate a table output in the console to show inline styles, HTML tags and shortcodes used in the `<content:encoded>` XML tag.

```bash
python manage.py analyze_html_content path/to/your/xmlfile.xml
```

### analyze_xml_content

Will generate a JSON file your project which shows the structure of all unique XML tags and attributes.

The file will be saved in the same location and with the same name as the original XML file as a `.json` file.

```bash
python manage.py analyze_xml_content path/to/your/xmlfile.xml
```

## Delete imported page command

When testing imports you may need to delete the imported pages and run the import again.

```bash
python manage.py delete_imported_pages [app] [page_model]
# app and page_model are required arguments
```

This script will run until all pages of [app].[model] have been deleted and displays the progress in the console.

**WARNING:** It will also delete any pages you have created in the Wagtail admin.

## Useful Django shell commands

To start the Django shell run

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

### Delete all images

**WARNING:** This command is destructive and will delete all images, there's no going back!

```python
from wagtail.images.models import Image
```

```python
Image.objects.all().delete()
```

### Delete all documents

**WARNING:** This command is destructive and will delete all documents, there's no going back!

```python
from wagtail.documents.models import Document
```

```python
Document.objects.all().delete()
```

## Errors while running an import

When running an import you may encounter errors in the console.

If the import starts and stops with the error `'NoneType' object has no attribute '_inc_path'` then you should try running the following command.

```bash
python manage.py fixtree
```

This command scans for errors in your database and attempts to fix any issues it finds.

## Databases

SQLITE3

If you are testing your import with an sqlite3 database, try to avoid making any changes in the Wagtail admin while a import is running.

The import process executes many save actions as it runs and you will likely create a lock on the database if you try to save updates in the Wagtail admin.

This will prevent the import process from completing a save or update.

Using a postgres or MySQL database avoids this situation.
